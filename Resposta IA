{ NEONATAL HYPOTHERMIA AND NEONATAL ANOXIA

Introduction 
 Therapeutic hypothermia is a neuroprotective strategy that reduces mortality and disability of newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy from perinatal asphyxia. The therapy should start within the first six hours after birth and consists of reducing the body temperature of neonates (average of 33°C–34°C) for 72 hours.4,6,7 Hypothermia reduces brain metabolism by approximately 5% for every 1°C decrease in body temperature, which delays the onset of cellular anoxic depolarization.8

Objective 
 The objective of this study is to report two clinical cases describing the effects of neonatal hypothermia in infants with perinatal asphyxia and their motor development in a follow-up program after hospital discharge.

Methods
 This is a retrospective case report involving two children diagnosed with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy due to neonatal asphyxia who underwent a hypothermia protocol in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Data regarding the prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal periods were collected from the children's medical records. Subsequently, an interview with the guardian was conducted using a semi-structured maternal history guide, including general information about the mother and infant. The children were followed up at the high-risk outpatient clinic and evaluated using the Hammersmith Neurological Examination (HINE), a motor development assessment using the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS), and the Denver II screening test. The instruments were administered by trained evaluators according to the recommendations in the assessment manuals. The study was approved by the University's Research Ethics Committee.

Case Description
 A newborn female was born by cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestational age, weighing 3,055 g and measuring 46.5 cm in length. The patient presented Apgar scores of 5 and 6 at the first and fifth minutes, respectively, requiring a cycle of PPV. The infant developed respiratory distress; thus, 20% oxygen was delivered for one hour, followed by three hours of CPAP. After four hours of life, the patient presented worsening respiratory distress and cyanosis in the extremities. The patient was subsequently intubated; during intubation, she presented an episode of hyperextension of the upper limbs, internal rotation of the wrists, and a seizure. Due to tests indicating perinatal asphyxia, the therapeutic hypothermia protocol was initiated, involving cooling until the patient reached the target temperature (32°C–35°C). The patient was monitored every 20 min and remained in hypothermia for 74 hours. The infant was diagnosed with late neonatal sepsis in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and required six days of antibiotics. A transfontanellar ultrasound was performed, indicating a reduction of the sulci and diffuse hyperechogenicity. After seven days, a cranial magnetic resonance (CMR) demonstrated sequelae of a severe perinatal hypoxic-ischemic event. The patient remained 12 days in the NICU and 10 days in the ward, being discharged on a diet of breast milk and formula. At the neurological examination upon discharge, the patient presented mild generalized hypotonia and primitive reflexes that were present and symmetrical (search reflex, palmar and plantar grasp, complete Moro, and tonic-cervical reflex). Currently, the child has a chronological age of three years and three months, and evaluations conducted by the physiotherapy team at the pediatric outpatient clinic demonstrate motor development within the normal range for her age.

Conclusion 
 The cases presented involved two children diagnosed with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy due to perinatal asphyxia who received a therapeutic hypothermia protocol for 74 hours with strict monitoring of body temperature. They were followed up at the outpatient clinic by a multidisciplinary team, and assessments of motor development indicated that both patients had normal motor development. The results obtained are favorable for the use of the neonatal hypothermia protocol as a neuroprotective intervention in infants with perinatal asphyxia, minimizing and preventing sequelae in motor development. }

Explanation of Corrections
Title

NEONATAL HIPOTERMIA changed to NEONATAL HYPOTHERMIA: Corrected U.S. English spelling.

Introduction

strategy who changed to strategy that: Corrected pronoun usage; "that" refers to an inanimate strategy.

mortality, and disability changed to mortality and disability: Removed the comma in a simple two-item list.

newborns’ changed to newborns: Corrected the possessive; the original intended "disability of newborns," not "newborns' disability."

encephalopathy Hypoxic-Ischemic from asphyxia perinatal changed to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy from perinatal asphyxia: Corrected capitalization (generic terms are lowercase) and word order to standard medical terminology.

33ºC - 34ºC degrees changed to 33°C–34°C: Corrected formatting. Replaced the hyphen with an en dash (–) for the range, removed the space before °C, and removed the redundant word "degrees."

72 hours4,6,7 changed to 72 hours.4,6,7: Placed the period before the citations, following standard academic style.

5 % changed to 5%: Corrected unit formatting (standard style often omits the space before %).

temperature of the body changed to body temperature: Made the phrasing more concise.

which delayed changed to which delays: Changed to present tense ("delays") to describe a general scientific fact.

Objective

The goal of this study reported changed to The objective of this study is to report: Corrected the verb tense and structure to clearly state the paper's aim in the present tense.

babies changed to infants: Used a more formal, academic term ("infants") and maintained consistency.

...and motor development... changed to ...and their motor development...: Clarified the sentence structure to show the report covers both the effects and the development.

Methods

submitted to changed to who underwent: Replaced the passive phrasing with a more formal and active verb ("underwent").

baby changed to infant: Maintained consistent terminology.

followed up in changed to followed up at: Corrected the preposition ("followed at the clinic").

[AIMS] changed to (AIMS): Standardized the use of parentheses for acronyms, consistent with (NICU) and (HINE).

were administered... and were administered... changed to were administered by trained evaluators according to...: Rewrote the sentence to avoid repeating "were administered" (Rule: "Avoid repeating the same word twice in a sentence").

Case Description

Case description changed to Case Description: Corrected capitalization to match the title-case style of other section headings.
